# Catching Pokémon

This is a single-player game app. This game is based on the classic game Whack-a-mole. But instead of mole coming out of the hole, there are Pokémons coming out of the hole for players to catch. When a player successfully catches a Pokémon, the score will increase. Randomly, there are bombs coming out of the hole, if the player accidentally catches the bomb, the score will decrease. The game will be set to 30s long for each round, the game goal is to catch as many Pokémons as player can.

This game app was written in html, css, and Javascript.
